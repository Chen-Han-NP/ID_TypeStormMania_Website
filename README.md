# TypeStorm Mania
This website holds a typing game that challenge users how fast they can type. The words being thrown at users are words from the programming languages python, javascript and c#. The game help users practise their typing speed and train themselves to push their typing speed limit further. There is a leaderboard section that shows the top 10 people who have the 10 highest scores in the database, and challenge others to try to beat their high scores.

# Design Process
This website uses mostly cool colours. On every page in the game, it uses a cool colour of blue and its many different shades. The background colour is kept the same for every javascript page to stick to a blue toned colour theme. In the game page, there are many referneces to coding. The background was picked carefully with the theme of code, and the ground of the game is screenshots of actual code found in our javascript game code. At the game over screen, the ground code becomes lines of error. The interactive buttons on the main, pause and game over screen page are interactive and upon hover change colour for a nice effect of seeing clearly the option your mouse is hovering over. The html background with the gif is selected to have cool colours with a bit of contrast of the moving waves of red dots and lines.
